      <h3><b>ABOUT</b></h3>
      Tupac Amaru Shakur (/ˈtuːpɑːk ʃəˈkʊər/; born Lesane Parish Crooks, June
      16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), also known by his stage names 2Pac and
      Makaveli, was an American rapper and actor. He is widely considered one of
      the most influential and successful rappers of all time.[1][2] Shakur is
      among the best-selling music artists, having sold more than 75 million
      records worldwide. Much of Shakur's music has been noted for addressing
      contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities, and he is considered
      a symbol of activism against inequality.

      Shakur was born in New York City to parents who were both political
      activists and Black Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, Afeni
      Shakur, he relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay
      Area in 1988. With the release of his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991,
      he became a central figure in West Coast hip hop for his conscious rap
      lyrics.[3][4] Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with
      his follow-up albums Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and Me Against
      the World (1995).[5] His Diamond certified album All Eyez on Me (1996),
      the first double-length album in hip-hop history, abandoned his
      introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap.[6] In addition to his music
      career, Shakur also found considerable success as an actor, with his
      starring roles in Juice (1992), Poetic Justice (1993), Above the Rim
      (1994), Bullet (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), and Gang Related (1997). During
      the later part of his career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a
      New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including
      incarceration. In 1995, Shakur served eight months in prison on sexual
      abuse charges, but was released pending an appeal of his conviction.
      Following his release, he signed to Marion "Suge" Knight's label Death Row
      Records and became heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast
      hip hop rivalry.[7] On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an
      unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas; he died six
      days later. Following his murder, Shakur's friend-turned-rival, the
      Notorious B.I.G., was at first considered a suspect due to their public
      feud; he was also murdered in another drive-by shooting six months later
      in March 1997 while visiting Los Angeles.[8][9] Shakur's double-length
      posthumous album Greatest Hits (1998) is one of his two releases—and one
      of only nine hip hop albums—to have been certified Diamond in the United
      States.[10] Five more albums have been released since Shakur's death,
      including his critically acclaimed posthumous album The Don Killuminati:
      The 7 Day Theory (1996)[11] under his stage name Makaveli, all of which
      have been certified Platinum in the United States.[12] In 2002, Shakur was
      inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame.[13] In 2017, he was inducted into
      the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.[14]
      Rolling Stone ranked Shakur among the 100 Greatest Artists of All
      Time.[15]

    <section id="RESUME">
      <h3><b>RESUME</b></h3>
      Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in the East Harlem section of Upper
      Manhattan, New York City.[16] While born Lesane Parish Crooks,[17][18][19]
      at age one he was renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur.[20] He was named after Tupac
      Amaru II, the descendant of the last Incan ruler, who was executed in Peru
      in 1781 after his failed revolt against Spanish rule.[21] Shakur's mother
      Afeni Shakur explained, "I wanted him to have the name of revolutionary,
      indigenous people in the world. I wanted him to know he was part of a
      world culture and not just from a neighborhood."[20] Shakur had an older
      stepbrother, Mopreme "Komani" Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa Shakur,
      two years his junior.[22]
